## EJS(Embeded Javascript Templete)
 *EJS is a simple templating language that lets you generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript. No religiousness about how to organize things. No reinvention of iteration and control-flow. It's just plain JavaScript.* 
   
   <div style="color:green;font-weight:900;font-size:30px"> INSTALLATION</div>
 
 ```
 npm install ejs
```
<span style="color:green;font-weight:900;font-size:30px">Set the View Engine in Express</span>
```
 var express = require('express');
var app = express();

// set the view engine to ejs
app.set('view engine', 'ejs');
```
## Express_js
 *Express.js is a small framework that works on top of Node.js web server functionality to simplify its APIs and add helpful new features. It makes it easier to organize your applicationâ€™s functionality with middleware and routing. It adds helpful utilities to Node.js HTTP objects and facilitates the rendering of dynamic HTTP objects.*
 ```
npm install express
```
```
const express = require('express')
const app = express()
```
## Mongodb
*MongoDB is a NoSQL database management application. NoSQL database systems offer an alternative to traditional relational databases using SQL (Structured Query Language). Data is stored in tables, rows, and columns in a relational database, with relationships between entities.*
  ### mongoose
  ```
   npm install mongoose
```
Connect to the MongoDB Database
```
mongoose.connect('mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/myapp');
```
